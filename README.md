# canvas_tab
ComfyUI canvas editor page


This plugin provides two nodes to provide a full page editor that runs in another tab.

There is an input node and an output node.

There is a green Tab on the side of images in the editor,  click on that tab to highlight it. 
The image with the highlighted tab is sent through to the comfyUI node. 

You can have multiple image layers and you can select generated images to be 
added as new layers.  

You can drag images around with the middle mouse button and scale them with the mouseWheel.


You can delete layers by clicking on the layer widget with Ctrl-LefTClick.
