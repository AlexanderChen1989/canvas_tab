# canvas_tab
ComfyUI canvas editor page

The canvas_tab directory goes into the custom_nodes folder.

It will try and make a symlink inside web/extensions/ to point to canvas_tab/web
If that doen't work you might have to copy the files over


At time of writing this plugin is only a few days old, so it's missing a lot of
features that I have planned,  some half-implemented stuff is in here.
